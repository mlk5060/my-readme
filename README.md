# README

_This README is in constant flux, like me!_ :sweat_smile:

There's no ego here, I just want us to understand each other, and I figured this little handbook may help! I like to be transparent and uncomplicated; hopefully this document goes someway towards achieving those goals!

Before we go any further though...

## Me

I am human, I make mistakes; that's normal and a good thing! If I make a mistake, we'll both learn something (hopefully)!

Ultimately, I like to **cause and drive change**. Some call this "progressive"; fine with me!

More specifically I like to

- Teach
- Innovate
- Create
- Alleviate
- Collaborate
- Elevate
- Motivate

### How I learn

Essentially, I'll read some theory, go and play with whatever the thing I'm learning about is, explore it practically, find out what doesn't work, look for solutions to fix what I broke, and implement those fixes. After a while, I'll know what does work, where to go to find answers to problems, some rote fixes, and working knowledge of best practices.

I've found that _only_ reading makes me dogmatic: and dogmatism is stifling for experimentation! I've found that I only get a shallow understanding of whatever the thing I'm learning is too, I need to apply what I'm learning in order to fully appreciate the lesson! Playing and breaking things also keeps me humble.

I also work visually: telling me something can help me to understand, and if the topic is something I'm familiar with, I'll get it, but I really get it if there are visuals used too!

## Me and you

We're both human, we make mistakes; that's normal and a good thing! If we make a mistake, we'll both learn something (hopefully)!

I'm not showy, I like to get my head down and collaborate with others to help them build things that will make people's lives better, including the engineers and people I work with :smile:

I like to have a laugh, and not take a job too seriously. Obviously, there's always a line, but I think we all do our best work when we are at ease, and are willing to make mistakes. I genuinely love doing work with friends, and that's the dynamic I hope our relationship has.

I really admire people who exhibit the following traits. If you do, we'll get on great (hopefully!). If we don't, and we need time to navigate each other's personalities, that's totally fine with me, let's be honest with each other!

- Fearlessness
- Empathy
- Artisinality
- Curiosity
- Trustworthiness
- Authenticity/Integrity
- Honesty
- Clarity
- Adaptability
- Respectfulness (**NOT** reverence)
- Humility
- Gratitude
- Humour

I have three traits I want to inspire and nurture in you if we work together:

1. Fearlessness
1. Empathy
1. Artisinality

### Fearlessness

- Push for innovation
- Question the status quo, relentlessly; shake it up
- Be bold, **be you**

### Empathy

- Kindness is everything
- Seek to understand others and ease their journey
- Support, don't admonish

### Artisinality

- Take pride in what you do
- Always ask "can I do this better?"
- Strive to create things that exhibit [QWAN](https://wiki.c2.com/?QualityWithoutaName) (the link concerns software engineering, but I think it can be generalised too :smile:)


## Me and Software Engineering

I am a scientist at heart[^1]. I believe the scientific method is the most powerful tool we have in order to create good software ![An infographic showing the cyclical nature of the scientific method with the steps: observation, question, hypothesis, experiment, analysis, conclusion](https://miro.medium.com/max/468/1*rc_EeVrnpcqAfwvVp0whRQ.png). Ultimately, the smaller I think we can make this loop, the better, and the more we can do to enable experimentation and analysis in a live environment: the better!

How do we make the loop smaller? I think we do this via [XP principles](http://www.agile-process.org/), and I do evangelise them wherever possible (apologies in advance). By the way, I knew of XP, but never cared to read about it in detail. It was only after an interview I had with a company called Codurance that I was told that what my guidelines for writing good software are, are actually the XP principles. Regardless, I think this speaks to the almost[^2] universal nature of the XP principles? Here they are for reference:

1. Communication
2. Simplicity
3. Feedback
4. Courage
5. Respect

I also think we can make the loop smaller via [The Three Ways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUOXDEvplRc)

1. Flow/Systems Thinking
2. Amplify feedback loops
3. Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning

Essentially, I advocate for creating environments where small, cross-functional teams of people can work together easily to:

1. Get customer feedback on what currently works/what's needed next
1. Design experiments based on that feedback, i.e. implement different ways of addressing the customer's feedback
1. Run those experiments

...and round and round we go. This is essentially the [Many More Much Smaller Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLusbyBpugs) concept created by GeePaw Hill.

### Communication


### Simplicity

For _everything_. We should always work to what we're limited by and software enginering is limited by people: what we can understand, what we can do, etc. With this in mind, I evangelise for simplicity at all times. That applies to technology choices, team organisation, system architecture etc. Life is better when its simple.

Write less code: design problems away.

- [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) FTW
- [Feature Flags](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/feature-flags/) FTW

Work in small teams: less comms, easier to communicate, schedule, etc.

### Feedback

### Courage

Good judgment comes from experience; experience can be good and bad.

Engineers need to play and break things, but in a way that is safe. 

How do we make it easy, fast, and safe to explore? The scientific method. When the scientific method is applied to engineering you get [Many more much smaller steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLusbyBpugs).

How do you implement this other than TDD? I advocate heavily for [Progressive Delivery](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/what-is-progressive-delivery-all-about/) in this regard. This video from [Dawn Parzych](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8RprFlSJhM) should adequately clarify my stance too :smile:

- [Testing in production/Minimal long-lived environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2oota_FhGY)

- [Test all the f\*\*king time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwUR0kOVNs8)

- [Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)


## Engineers I Admire

### Charity Majors

Charity completely blew my mind when I first heard her discussing the concept of testing in production. I am fully with her on this idea: I know there'll always be situations where an environment before releasing to live may be needed, but I think that testing in production and minimal long-lived environments (more on that later) should be the default for applications

### Sandi Metz

### Geepaw Hill 

### Kent C. Dodds

## Engineering Books

Admittedly, I don't read many books nowadays since having a small child takes up a lot of my spare time (amongst trying to exercise, spend time with my wife, do household chores, work etc)! However, I want to try and hold myself accountable, and to let you see what I like too, so here's a little section on engineering books :smile: You may be surprised that I don't mention certain books[^3] here...

### Top 3

1. [99 Bottles of OOP](https://sandimetz.com/99bottles)
2. [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php)
3.

## Tools I Love Using

[^1]: For my sins I worked for 4 years on a PhD and embarked on a post-doctoral degree, with the aim of becoming a professor someday!
[^2]: I am very much a nerd when it comes to software engineering and I love listening to podcasts, talks etc. and reading about how we can do it better. The creators of that content are generally people who were involved in designing XP, so I guess that's where this serendipity came from?!
[^3]: By the way, [Its probably time to stop recommending Clean Code](https://qntm.org/clean). After reading the book a few years ago, I only really took a few practices from it (a lot of the book seems to be an advertisement for his Fitness app :joy:). My main issue though is with Martin's general views of the world. They're diametrically opposed to mine, and (in my opinion) are harmful in a general social sense. You can read more about it [here](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/robert-martin).

# README

There's no ego here, I just want us to understand each other, and I figured this little handbook may help! I like to be transparent and uncomplicated, hopefully this goes someway towards achieving those goals1

This is a handbook that I hope helps you to understand me. I'm a simple guy so hopefully this won't take long :sweat_smile:

Before we go any further though...

## Me

I'm not showy, I like to get my head down and collaborate with others to help them build things that will make people's lives better.

Engineering rules are more like guidelines ![Hector Barbossa from the Curse of the Black Pearl movie saying "The code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual riles"](https://c.tenor.com/aeV80XD4CSgAAAAd/guidlines-pirates-of-the-caribbean.gif)

## What I want to achieve

I have three objectives, i.e. traits I want to inspire and nurture in you if we work together:

1. Fearlessness
1. Empathy
1. Artisinality

### Fearlessness

### Empathy



### Artisinality



### What I Like To Do

- **Cause change**
- Teach
- Innovate

- Elevate
- Motivate

### Qualities I Admire

- Fearlessness
- Empathy
- Artisinality
- Curiosity
- Trustworthiness
- Authenticity/Integrity

- Clarity
- Flexibility
- Respectfulness (**NOT** reverence)
- Humility

## Engineering Guidelines I Evangelise

### Keep it simple, stupid

### Move fast and break things

Good judgment comes from experience; experience can be good and bad.

Engineers need to play and break things, but in a way that is safe. 

How do we make it easy, fast, and safe to explore? The scientific method. When the scientific method is applied to engineering you get [Many more much smaller steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLusbyBpugs).

How do you implement this other than TDD? I advocate heavily for [Progressive Delivery](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/what-is-progressive-delivery-all-about/) in this regard. This video from [Dawn Parzych](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8RprFlSJhM) should adequately clarify my stance too :smile:

- [Testing in production/Minimal long-lived environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2oota_FhGY)

- [Test all the f\*\*king time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwUR0kOVNs8)

- [Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)

- 

- Unless it affects compilation, don't block builds for linting

### Small teams, rich functions

Small teams work better.

## Engineers I Admire

### Charity Majors

Charity completely blew my mind when I first heard her discussing the concept of testing in production. I am fully with her on this idea: I know there'll always be situations where an environment before releasing to live may be needed, but I think that testing in production and minimal long-lived environments (more on that later) should be the default for applications

# README

There's no ego here, I just want us to understand each other, and I figured this little handbook may help! I like to be transparent and uncomplicated, hopefully this goes someway towards achieving those goals1

This is a handbook that I hope helps you to understand me. I'm a simple guy so hopefully this won't take long :sweat_smile:

Before we go any further: black lives matter, and love is love.

## Me

I'm not showy, I like to get my head down and collaborate with others to help them build things that will make people's lives better.

Engineering rules are more like guidelines ![Hector Barbossa from the Curse of the Black Pearl movie saying "The code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual riles"](https://c.tenor.com/aeV80XD4CSgAAAAd/guidlines-pirates-of-the-caribbean.gif)

## What I want to achieve

I have three objectives, i.e. traits I want to inspire and nurture in you if we work together:

1. Fearlessness
1. Empathy
1. Artisinality

### Fearlessness

- Push for innovation, question the status quo, shake it up, be bold, relentlessly question

### Empathy



### Artisinality



## Qualities I admire

- Speaking truth to power

### Nouns

_Get this off your phone_

### Adjectives

_Get this off your phone_ 

## Engineering Principles I Evangelise

- Keep it simple, stupid
- Move fast and break things
- Minimal long-lived environments
- Testing in production
- Test all the f\*\*king time
- [Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests)
- Many more much smaller steps
- Small teams, rich functions
- Unless it affects compilation, don't block builds for linting

## Engineers I Admire

### Charity Majors

Charity completely blew my mind when I first heard her discussing the concept of testing in production. I am fully with her on this idea: I know there'll always be situations where an environment before releasing to live may be needed, but I think that testing in production and minimal long-lived environments (more on that later) should be the default for applications
